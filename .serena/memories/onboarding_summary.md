# Playwright Test Framework: Onboarding Complete

- Project is a Playwright-based E2E test framework using TypeScript.

- Uses Playwright config in `playwright.config.ts`.
- Follows Playwright and TypeScript best practices, including POM and fixtures.
- Scripts for test running, reporting, and codegen should be added to `package.json`.
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`).
- See `suggested_commands.md`, `code_style_and_conventions.md`, and `task_completion_checklist.md` for details.
